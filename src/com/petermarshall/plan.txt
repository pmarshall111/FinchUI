First we create the main page view.

Add in logos to buttons
Make buttons all be the same size
Centralise Title and subtitle

Move onto Search for Light page and finalise what sort of navigation we want.
Connect buttons with controllers


Thought: We will need a bridge between the 2 projects so the model of this UI can communicate with the Finch search for light program and also other programs.
If we keep all program data separate from the UI code, then we can just create an interface class within each project and access the data that way.
