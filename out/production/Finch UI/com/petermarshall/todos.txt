Want to make sure the only class from our other project we can access is the interface. Don't want to be able to mess with the program from outside source.

Need to add testing to both files.

Add centered panes so when we resize window the content always stays in the center

Stop SearchForLight from jumping to the top when we click stop.

Try out fast update frequency to see how that makes the program.

- Need to include a credits section for the icons usage.
- Possibly about page as well basically just listing what technology was used to create the project.


BUGS
- When state is searching for light, wheel velocity is always 100
-Possibly add in record readings for the first few seconds of waiting to be level.


- Also would like to line up text even if it has a border round it.
- Add in tooltip for the pie chart so we can see the time in each section. Same for light readings. Add tooltip to tell user
what minimum detected light val is.
- On Search for light, would prefer to have 1 big title for telemetry, then a subtitle for state and a subtitle for live stats.
Is really stupid to have these titles the same height as the main subtitles.

- Maybe put the back button in a solid bar across the top, above the title. The same length as the separator.
- Need colour structure over the page to add interest. Not too headliny though as that's what the buttons etc are for.
- Would be cool to colour the line on line chart based on what state the finch is in at that time.
