Want to make sure the only class from our other project we can access is the interface. Don't want to be able to mess with the program from outside source.

Need to add testing to both files.

Stop SearchForLight from jumping to the top when we click stop.

Try out fast update frequency to see how that makes the program.

- Need to include a credits section for the icons usage.
- Possibly about page as well basically just listing what technology was used to create the project.



Would like to

- Maybe put the back button in a solid bar across the top, above the title. The same length as the separator.
- Need colour structure over the page to add interest. Not too headliny though as that's what the buttons etc are for.
- Would be cool to colour the line on line chart based on what state the finch is in at that time.




Need to be done after
- Need to include a credits section for the icons usage.
- Possibly about page as well basically just listing what technology was used to create the project.
- Increase scrolling speed of scrollpane
- Add centered panes so when we resize window the content always stays in the center
- Custom cursor for things with tooltips
- Stop Finch after closing program window


- Would like wrapping width to be higher on search for light page.
- Also set the defailt width the program opens search for light page at to be higher.
- Set the percentage to be a positive or negative percentage.
- Look into changing the colour of the percentage bar based on what the value is.

Check into resizing the Text wrapping width to match the size of the window.
