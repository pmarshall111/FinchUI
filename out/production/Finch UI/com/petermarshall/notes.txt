MVC architecture

The model should contain the actual Finch knowledge. This updates the view. User manipulating the view alerts the controller which updates the model.

View contains info stored in the model. Controller handles user actions to the view. Model contains raw data.

Lots of nice ideas for extensions. But first, we must just get the base program working, being mindful of where we could want to expand. Then once we're done
we can think about adding additional features.

Shared Resources controllers

If we want to share information through controllers, we can either create a Singleton class with all the logic in there. Or we can create each controller using
the unique shared resources. I feel like a singleton is safer. In this tutorial, the guy decides to create each controller individually passing in the arguments.

He also has them extend an abstract class so that when he is initialising his scenes in the view part of the code, controllers can be passed in as an argument and nothing else.

If we just use a Singleton class as well then we do not need to set the Controller to an fxml file using code like this guy does in the tutorial. It can be contained within the fxml.
I feel like he has overcomplicated things somewhat to avoid using a Singleton class. Perhaps there is another reason for it...

A bean is a JavaFX class whose only responsibility is to contain data that will be deisplayed.
I believe we can use SimpleStringProperty from JavaFX Beans package to bind our data to our model so the view can be updated whenever the model is.

Plan for controller and changing views

I feel like there should just be 1 class within the view package called ViewManager, where the controllers can call methods to change the views.
